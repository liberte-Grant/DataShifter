# DataShifter

DataShifter is a powerful tool for testing system vulnerabilities, demonstrating how ransomware works, and studying cryptographic attack methods. The project includes functionality for forced file encryption on the target machine using military algorithms (AES-256, XOR obfuscation), as well as mechanisms for covert distribution and persistence in the system.
